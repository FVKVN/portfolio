description: Logo design for a tennis club
intro: When asked to do design of TC Keerpunt's new website I noticed that their current logo wasn't very legibal, it had a very thin outline, looked somewhat outdated and completely disapeared when used in a smaller size. I decided to try to bring it to the modern they and make it more sutable to be used across different media. This is what I proposed.
