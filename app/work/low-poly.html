description: A collection of experiments focused on low polygon rendering
intro: A collection of experiments with the aim of illustrating with a low amount of, and therefore big in size, polygons. Features only faces currently, but plans are in the making to broaden the subject matter. This also contains all matter of animating, messing with the svg in question, with as main example the first load animation you may have witnessed when visiting this website.
