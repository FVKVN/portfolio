intro: The Shift is the Belgian meeting point for sustainability.  Their goal is to transition to a more sustainable society and economy, think of them as a network that brings together like minded companies that strive to make this goal a reality. Their daughter company, Generation T has the same goals all be it more focused on the younger generation. We launched both sites simultaneously back in 2015.
